Contracts is a command line tool and a python module. Contracts is an inter-institutions effort to produce interoperability capabilities between tools and services for execution management in terms of reproducibility and provenance capture. Contracts provides two main features. A transform feature with which developers can ensure inter-tools/services schema to schema transformation. A storage feature with which developers can ensure inter-tools/services recordstore to recordstore migrations.
The present work was formalized in this repository during the AFRL/NIST gathering on September 2017. Contracts is provided for now with Maestrowf -> CoRR capability and we hope to improve it and grow in the direction of adding more tools: Sumatra, ReproZip, CDE, NoWorkflow, etc...
